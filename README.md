# Monero-on-BTCPay
A short guide on getting Monero setup on BTCPay

*Please note that Monero is considered a "Server-wide" implementation, and will not work on multi-store setups, unless all stores are receiving Monero to the same wallet. There can only be 1 wallet per SERVER, not per store like BTC based coins. 

## Installing Keys

To use Monero on BTCPay, you need to add a view only wallet, and view only keys file to the wallet in BTCPay. For instructions on how to generate these files for specific wallets, please see the list below. 

Once your key files are generated, navigate to the BTCPay store you wish to enable Monero for. 

### - Feather Wallet
I've found Feather Wallet to be my goto wallet, as it allows for things such as coin control. This can be useful in some cases, and segregating funds if needed.
